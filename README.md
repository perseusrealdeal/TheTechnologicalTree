`Step 1:` Make a new repository based on the template repository with all included branches

`Step 2:` Apply commits from the target branch into the main branch with cherry-pick command

`Step 3:` Push changes into the main branch then—`the preconfigured project template`—done

`Step 4:` Protect the main branch making possible adding changes only via pull requesting

`Step 5:` The main branch and the target branch—all others should be removed

`Step 6:` Rename the target branch with `v0.0.1`

`Step 7:` Update the target branch `v0.0.1` for the project specifics

`Step 8:` Create a pull request as `v0.0.1`

`Step 9:` Merge a pull request with the main branch—`the initial point of development process`—done
